MAG Core integration/staging repository
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/magnetwork/mag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/magnetwork/mag) [![GitHub version](https://badge.fury.io/gh/magnetwork%2Fmag.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/gh/magnetwork%2Fmag)

Since 2017, our primary focus has been on promoting the usage of [MAG](https://magnetwork.io), an open source cryptocurrency, for real-world use cases while providing truly decentralized solutions to our users.

To achieve this, we have built a suite of tools ([Magnet Merchant Tools](https://merchant.magnetwork.io)) for merchants to easily and securely transact without any middleman. These tools provide merchants with automated invoicing and seamless integration to the most common online shopping platforms (e.g. WooCommerce). Get setup with a merchant account in no time. It is free, peer-to-peer and secure.

We also strongly believe that the incentivized two-tier model brought about by masternodes is the best way to create the commitment and retention needed for perennial growth. In addition to creating a robust and highly serviceable network, we see the masternode ecosystem as a means to long-term investment. For this purpose, we have developed a full-featured masternode management app which is currently available on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.magnetwork.mnapp&hl=en_US).
